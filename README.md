## About
This is a modular project demonstrating 2 dynamic UI interactions. 

The drop down menu takes in an array of strings and displays them in the drop down menu. These links can be used to change the page accordingly. The drop down menu changes for mobile and web users.

The Image slider takes all the images in the images folder and creates a slider for them. The images are converted to webp format with webpack to improve performance. The slider will automatically cycle through the photos on a timer. The user can cycle through the images manually by clicking on the dots or the right and left side.
